# Pythonopoly
A monopoly game made with python. Hope you enjoy!

Update Log: (3/24/22)

- Added a system to detect if you own a property so you are not
charged rent on your own property. 

- Added a system to detect when a players balance is < 1 so that
the the game ends for a two player game.

- Added dice animations, text speeds, and color coordinated player text.

Future update plans:

- The mortgage system isn't operational and I plan to fix that soon.

- Players who own properties will receive rent when another player lands on it. 

- More COMMUNITY CHEST and CHANCE outcomes.
